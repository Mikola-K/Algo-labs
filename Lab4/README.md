# Algo labs 4

## Task:
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm and construct a tree of the shortest paths from a given vertex s for an oriented, weighted graph.
The solution is the average path length from a given vertex to all other vertices that can be reached with s.

## Incoming data:
The first line contains the numbers N - the number of edges and s - the initial vertex.
The next N lines contain pairs of vertices connected by an edge and the weight of this edge.
 
## Output data:
Average path length
